        <h2>TOGETHER, <span>WE CAN.</span></h2>
        <p>The Brighter World is a platform for sharing our visions, thoughts & ideas for a
prosperous, sustainable & progressive India. And then, working collaboratively to make
it happen.<br/><br/>

The mission of The Brighter World is to identify tangible ideas that can be implemented
collaboratively and help in addressing common issues that we all face in our day to day
lives. We may not be able to resolve the issues at hand completely, but we can
definitely make a start.<br/><br/>

We urge you to join hands in this endeavor. Share your dreams and thoughts for India.
Identify what is preventing us from achieving the same and then lets plan to address the
same together. The dream may be about anything, small or big...as long as it is about
progress of India and Indians, we can take it up. There is only one caveat; the thoughts
and ideas must be apolitical, non-communal and non-discriminatory.<br/><br/>

If you have an idea or thought that you have been mulling over and didn't know where
to begin, lets talk about it and see what we can do together. We would find a way to
get it implemented collaboratively with the help of like minded friends.<br/><br/>

One person may not have the strength to get the wheels turning, but
Together, We Can.</p>
